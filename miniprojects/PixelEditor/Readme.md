# PixelEditor

My most favorite image editing program is kolourpaint. Unfortunatunelly kolourpaint is not the best when drawing pixelart images (which are needed for e.g. [Config TD](https://github.com/PascalCorpsman/ConfigTD)). After some research i found these two

- https://makepixelart.com/free#
- https://www.piskelapp.com/p/create/sprite

both are good, but do not perfectly fit my needs. So i decided to write my own pixel editing program.
