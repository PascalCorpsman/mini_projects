# Sudoku

Initially writen in Delphi 5 (and first published 2005 on https://www.Corpsman.de) this code was later ported to Lazarus and then "forgotten". On request i now publish the code <s> with more or less no changes. So be prepared. This code is a mess, but also a proof that even bad code can create a nice looking program</s> (code was refactored a lot and should now at least "readable" [see commit history of this repository from  to 2024-12-20 to 2025-01-06]).
