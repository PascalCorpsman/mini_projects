# RGB Jumper

> ! Work in progress !, not yet working

This is a tiny jump and run game, inspired by a youtube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=RHmTvQ5xc-BMPEPb&v=YtylfQq2JII&feature=youtu.be) (10:16) i recently saw..

The main idea of the game is to "run" to the golden block. The player can change colors by either typing the "r", "g", "b" keys (or "c" to cycle colors). Collision is only to Map tiles with the same color, the rest you will figure out ;).
