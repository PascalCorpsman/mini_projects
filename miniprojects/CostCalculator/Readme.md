# Cost calculator

I am a owner of a photovoltaic system and was curious how effective the system is. If you have all data of consumption and generation you can play with the numbers to see different impact values ;).

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Cost per kWh | the amount you have to pay for 1 kWh
| Profit per kWh | the amount you get payed for providing 1kWh
| Akkusize in kWh | the size of the battery
| from Net [MWh] | the amount of energy which actually was consumed by the measuring point from the net
| Akku->House [MWh] | the amount of energy which was transfered from your "local" akku to your house
| Sun->House [MWh] | the amount of energy which was directly feed from the sun to your house
| to Net [MWh] | the amount of energy which was provided to the net (not used in house)
| Sun->Akku [MWh] | the amount of energy that was used to recharge the akku
