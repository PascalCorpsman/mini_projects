I am a owner of a photovoltaic system and was curious how effective the system is. If you have all data of consumption and generation you can play with the numbers to see different impact values ;).

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Cost per kWh | the amount you have to pay for 1 kWh
| Profit per kWh | the amount you get payed for providing 1kWh
| Akkusize in kWh | the size of the battery
